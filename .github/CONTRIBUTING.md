## Contributing to mockturtle

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for your interest in contributing! :tada::+1:

### Pull request check list

Please go through this self-check list before/during making a pull request.

#### Before making a PR

- [ ] **Unit testing:** If you add new functionalities (new data structures, new utilities, new algorithms, etc.), please add unit tests in the `test/` folder to test your code thoroughly.
- [ ] **Documentation:** If you add new functionalities, please write sufficient documentation to let people know how to use your code. Besides writing comments in the code, you also need to add some lines in the corresponding `.rst` file or even adding a new `.rst` file (when doing so, remember to add this file in the appropriate `index_*.rst` file). Try to compile and preview the edited documentation webpage by running `make html` in the `docs/` folder.
- [ ] **Coding style:** Please run `clang-format -i <path_to_files_you_edited>` to make sure that the code you contribute adheres to the coding style of the project.
- [ ] **Final check:** It's a good idea to check the "files changed" page (which you should see during submitting the PR, or by clicking on "compare branch"). Make sure everything is intended, and there is no extra debugging code or files generated by your editor etc.

#### After submitting a PR

- [ ] **Change log:** Remember to record your contributions in the change log by adding an item in [changelog.rst](https://github.com/lsils/mockturtle/blob/master/docs/changelog.rst). (You will refer to the PR number, which is easier to look up *after* submitting the PR.)
- [ ] **CI tests:** Make sure that the CI tests pass (i.e., having a green check mark). If this is your first time contributing to mockturtle, you might need to wait for a maintainer to manually approve and run the CI tests.
- [ ] **Test coverage:** If the CI tests pass, after a while, the code coverage bot should leave a comment in your PR, showing the changes on the test coverage. It would be nice to have it slightly increased, or at least not dropping too much. Try adding more tests to increase the number.
- [ ] It will be annoying to the maintainers if you keep adding more commits after submitting the PR. If this is needed, you may close the PR or turn it into a draft temporarily. When it's ready for review, add a comment to let the maintainers know.
