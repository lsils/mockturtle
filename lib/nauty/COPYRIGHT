---END-OF-FORMAL-COPYRIGHT-NOTICE---

Earlier (pre-2.6) versions of this package carried a different
notice: "Permission is hereby given for use and/or distribution
with the exception of sale for profit or application with nontrivial
military significance." These days most people use nauty via a
larger package such as Magma, Sage, or GAP, and often they don't
even know they are using nauty. Due to the legal nonsense that
large package distributors need to worry about, it has proved too
much trouble to maintain an idiosyncratic licence. I didn't change
my opinion about military use, but it is no longer part of the
formal notice. Brendan McKay (Jan 20, 2016)
